# probable-turtle
A python turtle thing that changes direction randomly, should *statistically* fill up the entire screen, but we'll see what happens...

I plan to turn it into a "Twitch Plays" type thing ---> it's interesting to watch without interaction, but with interaction it'll be even better!
