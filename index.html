  V1.0<br><script src="https://pastebin.com/embed_js/MSc6CSnc?theme=dark"></script><br>I plan to implement a pause feature (half implemented here), ability to press A and D (or left and right) to control the thing [and if no key is pressed, it does random movement] and after that I'm gonna adapt it to be a "Twitch Plays" type thing --- it's super satisfying to watch, and could be rlly interesting to see the random being influenced by 'the public'.
